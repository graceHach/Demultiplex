# Create variables for number of reads that are matched, undetermined, and hopped, initialize the value to zero
# Create a set of the 24 barcodes  
# Open the files for hopped and undetermined reads
# Initialize a dictionary - this will hold all matched barcode pairs (keys) and a tuple containing the names of the file handles (values). When a new, matched, high quality index pair is seen, the files (R1 and R2) for this pair will be opened, so whether or not a pair is present in the dictionary indiciates whether the file is already open
# Open all four files simultaneously, using a open() and a while-True loop
# Iterate over the lines of each file in groups of four
# For each group of four lines:
	# Read into memory the fastQ IDs, the, barcodes the sequence lines, and the Q score lines for one record at a time, for all four files
	# Generate the reverse compliment of R3, override the original value of R3_seq with its compliment
	# Create two new ID lines with fastQ IDs for both R1 and R2 by appending both barcodes to the end of the original fastQ IDS  
	# Check if there are any Ns in the indices, or if the indices are below the quality cutoff
		# If so, write R1 and R2, with their respective new ID lines to the undetermined file
		# increment undetermined count
	# Check of the barcodes match
		# If not, write R1 and R2, with their respective new ID lines to the undetermined file
		# increment hopped count
	# If neither of the above conditions is met, this is high quality and matched, so the matched count should be incremented
	# Check if the index-pair is stored in the dictionary
		# If so, write the records and new ID lines to the appropriate files using the file handles in the dictionary
		# If not, open the file for R1 and R2
			# Add the barcode pair to the dictionary as a key and the file handles packed together into a tuple as the value
			# write the records and new ID lines to the appropriate files using the file handles
# break when EOF is reached
# Iterate through dictionary, close all open files
# Report number of matched, hopped, and undetermined indices
